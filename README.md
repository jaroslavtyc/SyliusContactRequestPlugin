This plugin saves contact requests made on the native form into the database allowing us to see them in the back-office of Sylius.

## Installation

Install the plugin via composer:

```bash
composer require monsieurbiz/sylius-contact-request-plugin
```

## Getting started

Submit a contact request from the native contact form. Then go in the back-office in the customer menu node you will have a new menu 'contact requests', click on it, and 
you can see a grid with the contact requests created.
Obviously, this plugin is not retroactive and contact requests made before this plugin was installed will not be displayed.

### For the installation without flex, follow these additional steps

Change your `config/bundles.php` file to add this line for the plugin declaration:

```php
<?php
// config/bundles.php

return [
    //..
    MonsieurBiz\SyliusContactRequestPlugin\MonsieurBizSyliusContactRequestPlugin::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

Copy the plugin configuration files in your `config` folder:

```bash
cp --recursive --verbose vendor/monsieurbiz/sylius-contact-request-plugin/recipes/1.0/config/* config
```

### Migrations

Run previous Doctrie migrations, if any, to have application synchronized with SQL database :
```php
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

Make a doctrine migration diff : 

```php
bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
```

Then run it : 

```php
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```
